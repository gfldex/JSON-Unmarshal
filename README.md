# JSON::Unmarshal

Make an Object from JSON (the opposite of JSON::Marshal)

## Synopsis

```
    use JSON::Unmarshal;

    class SomeClass {
        has Str $.string;
        has Int $.int;
    }

    my $json = '{ "string" : "string", "int" : 42 }';

    my SomeClass $object = unmarshal($json, SomeClass);

    say $object.string; # -> "string"
    say $object.int;    # -> 42

```

It is also possible to use a trait to control how the value is unmarshalled:

```

    use JSON::Unmarshal

    class SomeClass {
        has Version $.version is unmarshalled-by(-> $v { Version.new($v) });
    }

    my $json = '{ "version" : "0.0.1" }';

    my SomeClass $object = unmarshal($json, SomeClass);

    say $object.version; # -> "v0.0.1"

```

The trait has two variants, one which takes a Routine as above, the other
a Str representing the name of a method that will be called on the type
object of the attribute type (such as "new",) both are expected to take
the value from the JSON as a single argument.

## Description

This provides a single exported subroutine to create an object from a
JSON representation of an object.

It only initialises the "public" attributes (that is those with accessors
created by declaring them with the '.' twigil. Attributes without acccessors
are ignored.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working perl6 installation you should be able to
install this with *ufo* :

    ufo
    make test
    make install

*ufo* can be installed with *panda* for rakudo:

    panda install ufo

Or you can install directly with "panda":

    # From the source directory
   
    panda install .

    # Remote installation

    panda install JSON::Unmarshal

Other install mechanisms may be become available in the future.

## Support

This should be considered experimental software until such time that
Perl 6 reaches an official release.  However suggestions/patches are
welcomed via github at

    https://github.com/tadzik/JSON-Unmarshal
